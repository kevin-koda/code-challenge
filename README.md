# CourierGateway - Code Challenge 2022

## Instructions

This is a simple challenge to review how code is implemented by candidates.  
We expect a simple and concise implementation, with testable code.

## Challenge

For this challenge, you'll interact with the Holidays API.  

We'll assess your ability as a software engineer working in different areas: ability to handle HTTP requests, view creation and data manipulation for presentation, ability to write testable code, etc.

### Exercise Scope

- Country View Page
  - Simple Table with country information: name, region, code, no. countries bordering the current one.
